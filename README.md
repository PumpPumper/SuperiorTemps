# SuperiorTemps
A program that parses data files produced by buoys deployed on Lake Superior to output a file of average summer surface water temperatures.

Run this program using Python 3.

BuoySummer.py is the script to run.

All the .txt files and .py files should be saved to the same directory for this to work.
